            <p>Ekklesia Community Church welcoms you!</p>
            <p>By God’s grace we pray that ECC will always be a body, a church, a family and a home that is defined by God’s presence. Worshipful, missional, prayerful, generational, creative, generous, thankful, authentic and completely passionate about
                people responding to the message of salvation. And with a shout that resounds through every part of our lives that HOPE is a person, and His name is Jesus.</p>

                        Here at ECC, church services are done a little differently. There is an emphasis on community and living life together, like a family.

                        As we get closer to launching, this will begin to take shape. There will be future updates through various social media accounts as well.
