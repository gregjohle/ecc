            <h2>Welcome to Your New Home</h2>
            <p>Ekklesia Community Church welcomes you!</p>
            <p>
                Our vision for ECC is based on Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Godly friendships that you can count on, in a world that is increasingly opposed to Christ.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                By God’s grace we pray that ECC will always be a body, a church, a family and a home that is defined by God’s presence. Worshipful, missional, prayerful, generational, creative, generous, thankful, authentic and completely passionate about people responding
                to the message of salvation. And with a shout that resounds through every part of our lives that HOPE is a person, and His name is Jesus.

                <h4>Service Times:</h4>
                <p>
                    Here at ECC, church services are done a little differently. There is an emphasis on community and living life together, like a family. We imagine the church not as a building, but as Christ moving in people globally.

                <p>
                    As we get closer to launching, this will begin to take shape. There will be future updates through various social media accounts as well.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        We are not a "Church" in the American sense. We are a fellowship of friends who believe that salvation happens in your co-workers, neighbors, friends, and family by the grace of God, because they believe in Jesus. This faith comes through individual relationships,
                        not because they came to a building.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Salvation is a free gift offered to all. The only requirement is to believe in Jesus Christ, and His completed work on the cross. The Holy Spirit is evidence of salvation, freely given to all who accept Jesus. The Holy Spirit is here to convict believers
                        of the truth through revelation of God's word. Conviction is not condemnation. As believers, all sins are forgiven, once and for all, on the cross. As a believer draws nearer to Christ, growing in the revelation of their identity
                        in Christ, the sins and worldly ideations will fall away from their life.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It is not the role of the church to condemn others for their failure to live up to perfection. Instead, it is our job to affirm others in the truth of their identity in Christ. We encourage them to grow and walk out their faith under the guidance of the
                        Holy Spirit. "For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God's glorious standard. Yet God, in His grace, freely makes us right in His sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when He freed us from the penalty of our sins" Romans
                        3:23-24 (NLT)
